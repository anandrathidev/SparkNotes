Sort-Merge join:
Is composed of 2 steps. The first step is to sort the datasets and the second operation is to merge the sorted data in the partition by iterating over the elements 
and according to the join key join the rows having the same value.

From spark 2.3 Merge-Sort join is the default join algorithm in spark. 
However, this can be turned down by using the internal parameter 


‘spark.sql.join.preferSortMergeJoin’ which by default is true.


Broadcast joins:
import org.apache.spark.sql.functions.broadcast
val dataframe = largedataframe.join(broadcast(smalldataframe), "key")

maximum size for the broadcast table 8GB. Thus, it is not possible to broadcast tables which are greater than 8GB.

Size to automatically apply broadcast joins. The threshold can be configured using “spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold”.
